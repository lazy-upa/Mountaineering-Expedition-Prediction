# Mountaineering Success Prediction Tool

The project uses **logistic regression** to predict whether or not a can successfully ascend a mountain based on different parameters like the mountain, season, oxygen usage, and whether a professional is hired or not.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: The data has been visualized to gain different decision-making insights.

- **Success Prediction**: The model has been tested with various metrics to ensure it correctly predicts.

- **Interactive Input**: A simple button-based input selection has been implemented.

 

## Methodology

 

1. **Data Preprocessing**
Preprocessed raw data to be uniform and ready for modeling.

 

2. **Dataset Merging**
Combine multiple related datasets for a more informative, richer analysis.

 

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Explored various insights in the data for model development.

4. **Logistic Regression**
Used logistic regression to predict whether or not a mountaineer is gonna succeed.

5. **Prediction Engine**
Created a simple-to-use prediction engine.
